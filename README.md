# Item Magnet Mod

This is a fabric mod which adds a simple Item Magnet to the game.

## Description

This mod adds an Item Magnet to the game. It is intended to be a non-cheat way to more easily pick up items surrounding you. It can also be useful for various situations where items would otherwise be lost or hard to retrieve (Like mining over lava or in the end).
The Item Magnet is intended to be a late game item, therefore it is not easy to come by and only aquireable after some progress in the game or with some luck.

## Installation

* Open the project in your favorite IDE (I use IntelliJ IDEA).
* Wait for gradle to be initialized (This should happen automatically).
* Run the gradle task `fabric/genSources` to generate the minecraft sources.
* Restart the IDE.
* You're all set.
